I'm a PhD student at the University of Toronto working on the [ATLAS Experiment](https://atlas.cern) at the [Large Hadron Collider](https://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) at [CERN](http://home.cern/), which I joined in Sept 2015 as an undergraduate at Carleton University. I'm interested in the physics of elementary particles at the energy frontier, particularly studies of the Higgs boson and searches for physics beyond the [Standard Model](https://home.cern/about/physics/standard-model).

Among other things I also enjoy writing, photography, comedy, cycling and all things science. I'm discovering a growing interest in free and open-source software as well; check out some of my projects over on [Github](https://github.com/joeycarter).
